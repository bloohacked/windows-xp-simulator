<p align="center">RebornXP is a web-based desktop environment that brings back the late 2000's personal computing experience right to your desktop, but in a modern way. It emulates the look and feel of Windows XP, providing users with a nostalgic and fun experience while also offering modern features like an app store, user accounts, and browser storage.
  </p>

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

### App Store

RebornXP includes an app store where users can download and install a variety of applications. The app store currently includes a text editor, calculator, image viewer, and more.

### New Themes

RebornXP comes with a few different themes that users can choose from. These themes provide different color schemes and wallpaper options to customize the desktop.

### User Accounts

Users can create and sign in to their own accounts, which allow them to customize their desktop settings and preferences. Each user's settings are saved in browser storage, so they can be accessed from any device.

### Browser Storage

RebornXP uses browser storage to save user settings, preferences, and files. This means that all data is stored locally in the user's browser and is accessible even after the user closes the window or refreshes the page.

### File Management
mmmm
RebornXP allows users to upload local files from their host operating system to RebornXP's file system, and vice versa. Users can simply copy files from their host OS and paste them into the RebornXP folder, or download files from RebornXP to their host OS.

<h2 align="center">Planned Features</h2>

- **Database System**: RebornXP plans to add a database system, which will allow users to store and access data from a remote server. This will eliminate the need to store data in the browser, making it more secure and reliable.

- **More Apps**: RebornXP plans to add more applications to the app store, including games, productivity tools, and utilities.

- **Redesigned Taskbar**: RebornXP plans to redesign the taskbar with more items, such as a network icon, sound icon, and other useful features.

<h2 align="center">Contributing</h2>

You are free to open issues and send pull requests - I'll happily merge them. If you are a developer and want to publish your web app to the App Store, [click here](https://github.com/shoaib-jamal/app-guide) to learn how.

<h2 align="center"> Usage</h2>

To run RebornXP locally, simply clone this repository to your local machine and run any web server from the directory (simply opening index.html won't work). You can also visit the live version of RebornXP [here](https://rebornxp.js.org).

Once you've launched RebornXP, you can navigate the desktop using the mouse and keyboard, open applications from the app store, and upload/download files from the file manager. Make sure to sign in to your user account to save your settings and preferences.

I hope you enjoy using RebornXP as much as I enjoyed creating it!
